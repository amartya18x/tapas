This page provides codes for reproducing our results. We use two main libraries here:

* The very awesome [**SHEEP**](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/SHEEP) library prepared by[ Oliver and Nick](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering/#people) to run  boolean circuits on ecnrypted data using various homomorphic encryption schemes for our networks.
* Our own general purpose library, **matSHEEP**, which provides a programmatic interface to design and visualize logic circuits for deep neural networks in python. Find more abour **matSHEEP** at [this link](https://amartya18x.github.io/matSHEEP).


There are two main types of experiments. 
* [Doing Prediction over Encrypted Data using Binary Neural Netwrks.](https://amartya18x.github.io/tapas/private_predictions) 
* [Recording accuracies for various levels of sparsity of a binary neural network.](https://amartya18x.github.io/tapas/bnn)
