This page provides codes for reproducing our results. There are two main types of experiments. We use the very awesome SHEEP library (which will be released very soon) prepared by Oliver and Nick to run the boolean circuits for our networks. However, to prepare the network, we have our own general purpose library, matSHEEP, which provides a programmatic interface to design and visualize circuits for deep neural networks in python.
